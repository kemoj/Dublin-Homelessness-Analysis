Homelessness in Dublin analysis
1) There were more homeless adults in Ireland in 2019 compared to both 2020, and 2021 (though, it should be remembered that there are four months missing in 2021)

2) The highest number of homeless adults are in the Dublin region, while the second highest (which is significantly lower) is in the South-West Region (Cork and Kerry Counties).

3) The number of accommodation that has been used or has been available (not made clear on the website) has dropped between 2019 and 2020, but the number is still higher than the number of homeless adults in Ireland. It should be noted, however, it is not clear from the website whether these were repeated users of the accommodation or what percentage of homeless adults used the population, therefore, any clear interpretation of these findings would be totally speculative.

4) Private Emergency Accommodation makes up the most of accommodation with Supported Temporary Accommodation being second. As pointed out several times, many politicians believe that Private Accommodation should be significantly reduced, and better measures should take it's place.
