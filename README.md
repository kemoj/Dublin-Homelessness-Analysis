This project examines homelessness trends in Ireland with a focus on Dublin between 2019–2021. Using publicly available homelessness data, the analysis explores yearly trends in homeless adults, regional differences, and patterns in accommodation types used across the country.

The goal of this project is to provide clear, data-driven insights that can support discussion, policy considerations, and further research into homelessness in Ireland.
