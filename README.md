#Ireland Homelessness Analysis
This project examines homelessness trends in Ireland with a focus on Dublin between 2019–2021. Using publicly available homelessness data, the analysis explores yearly trends in homeless adults, regional differences, and patterns in accommodation types used across the country.

The goal of this project is to provide clear, data-driven insights that can support discussion, policy considerations, and further research into homelessness in Ireland.

#Key Insights
1. Yearly Trends (2019–2021)

2019 recorded the highest number of homeless adults in Ireland, higher than both 2020 and 2021.

Note: 2021 contains only eight months of data, so comparisons must be treated cautiously.

2. Regional Differences

The Dublin region had the highest number of homeless adults, far exceeding all other regions.

The South-West region (Cork & Kerry) had the second-highest, though still significantly lower than Dublin.

3. Accommodation Availability/Usage

The number of accommodation units either used or available (unclear based on the data source) decreased between 2019 and 2020.

Despite the drop, the accommodation figure remained higher than the total number of homeless adults.

Due to missing details on:

repeat usage,

unique individuals served,

percentage of homeless adults who accessed accommodations,
any strong interpretation would be speculative.

4. Types of Accommodation

Private Emergency Accommodation (PEA) represents the largest share of accommodation options.

Supported Temporary Accommodation (STA) is the second largest category.

Policymakers have frequently argued that PEA reliance should be reduced in favour of more sustainable, long-term housing measures.
